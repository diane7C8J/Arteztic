# NFTArtForThePlanet
Through an Alliance DAO, we want to create a self-sustained coalition of NFT artists to foster climate-awareness and nudge climate-action. 

## Challenge
A growing number of artists are concerned and committed to the environmental crisis that we are all experiencing. Changing priorities, practices, discourse, we all adapt so that our creations play their part in this quest for change. We use our means of production and communication to inspire and share. But very quickly we run out of steam. So we produce more, saying to ourselves that this fight cannot be dropped, we cannot lose it.

But today, we are facing a system which is not sustainable for the artists and the Planet:

Artists are blocked by intermediaries who often don't share the same value and search for climate impact. The market is based on short-term exhibitions, fame and financial value rather than the potential of change of the artwork itself. Without even mentioning the blatant lack of diversity and inclusion inhibiting the expression of diverse voices and perspectives.

For these purpose-driven artists to continue to produce, we need to find an alternative to the current model where circularity is a rule.

## Concept 
The idea of this coalition is to bring together NFT artists who carry an environmental message in their art practice and to join forces by moving away from the restrictive models of the conventional art market.

A purpose-driven use of the Blockchain technology and more especially an Alliance DAO can introduce a new form of collective value creation without traditional intermediaries, and top of decentralised value distribution. 

This Alliance DAO will be run on the Tezos Blockchain for obvious environmental, inclusivity and openness reasons aligned with impact-driven art practices.

This Alliance DAO will be self-sustained thanks to the art donations of artists being sold and the funds being distributed.

### Goals
Our ambition serves personal, collective and planetary goals: 
1. amplify the impact of purpose-driven NFT artists by joining forces to foster climate-awareness and climate-action
2. create a self-sustainable model for purpose-driven art production 
3. directly support purpose-driven NGOs with artist's sales

### Purpose
**An independent coalition of NFT artists with a shared-goal: planet care.** 
**To approach this goal, our means are:** 
- educating environmental artists on the low-carbon footprint of Tezos Blockchain and inviting them to produce clean NFTs
- raising awareness on the current climate emergency (planet, nature, biodiversity) through art
- nudging climate actions through art
- lobbying at different levels through shared communication and collective exhibitions
- self-sustainability through art commoning
**and our tool will be:** 
- an Alliance DAO based on the Tezos Blockchain powered by art donations from the artists
