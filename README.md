# ArTEZtic
Through a DAO, we want to create a self-sustained coalition of NFT artists to foster climate-awareness and nudge climate-action. 

## In Brief
The Arteztic DAO wants to act as a decentralised autonomous NGO. We are a group of environmental NFT artists deciding to join forces to amplify the impact of our artworks, find alternative models to sustain our practices and create a donation culture in the art market.

Fully community led, the DAO will decide collectively on the onboarding of new members, on the distribution of funds gathered from the sales of the NFTs donated by the members, the selection of a list of NGOs to support and the selection of members' projects to support. 

The DAO will also have a public facing website presenting the group and its purpose, a permanent gallery showcasing artworks from the members, temporary virtual exhibitions, the presentation of our members-led projects and an ongoing call for members.

## Vision
An independent coalition of NFT artists with a shared-goal: planet care

## Mission 
The idea of this coalition is to bring together NFT artists who carry an environmental message in their art practice and to join forces by moving away from the restrictive models of the conventional art market.

A purpose-driven use of Blockchain technology and more especially an Alliance DAO can introduce a new form of collective value creation without traditional intermediaries, and top of decentralized value distribution. 

This Alliance DAO will be run on the Tezos Blockchain for obvious environmental, inclusivity, and openness reasons aligned with impact-driven art practices.

This Alliance DAO will be self-sustained thanks to the art donations of artists being sold and the funds being distributed.

### Goals
Our ambition serves personal, collective, and planetary goals: 
1. **Amplify the impact of purpose-driven NFT artists** by joining forces to foster climate awareness and climate action / lobbying for climate justice through art with collective initiatives (shared communication, collaborations, collective exhibitions, )
2. **Create a self-sustainable model for purpose-driven art production** / finding an alternative model to the art industry by accessing self-sustainability through art commoning 
3. **Create the first online gallery of NFT art acting for the Planet**
4. **Directly support purpose-driven NGOs** with artist's sales and create a new culture of the arts supporting purpose-driven projects.

### Activities
**To approach this goal, our means are:** 
1. **Environmental NFT Art production** - supporting the art production of environmental NFT artists 
_activities_: share earnings from the DAO's pool with DAO's members to support their production of new artworks, support more collaborations between NFT artists, support collective virtual or physical exhibitions, performances, or projects
2. **Raising awareness** - turn artists and the art world into cleanNFTs literates by educating on the low-carbon footprint of Tezos Blockchain, highlighting the benefits of NFT art  and inviting them to produce clean NFTs. 
_activities_: promotion of our DAO, public speaking, press release, collective art activism campaigns
3. **Support NGOs** - create a culture of donations within the art market by making it systematic and not occasional. 
_activities_: through a split contract, one part of the earnings from the sell of an NFT will be directed to an NGO. Buying a NFT from a member of the DAO is becoming a way to support NGOs directly.

### Audience
Our DAO targets environmental artists acting or willing to be in the NFT space, NFT artists supporting climate action, nature awareness or environmental messages through their art. 

Within their artistic practice, our members address the environmental transformations and biodiversity resulting from the Anthropocene, they call for a better understanding of nature and a new symbiotic relationship between species, they imagine new worlds to tell new stories and inspire change.

What is Environmental Art? It is a contemporary form of art created by artists who are concerned about local and global environmental situations. It is through their artistic practice that they address the current crises of the environment, the biodiversity and the planetary emergency more globally.
